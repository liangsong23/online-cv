    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm a technical writer who's okay with using contractions. I've worked
      in the networking and FinTech fields, contributing to user manuals, API
      docs, release notes, and instructional videos.

      I'm passionate about the user experience and always think about content
      strategy, information architecture, and the writing itself.
